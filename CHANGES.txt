
MiniConnectionPoolManager Changes
---------------------------------

2011-05-26 chdh
- New directory structure (Maven compatible).

2009-08-21 chdh
- ArrayDeque (which was introduced with change 2009-06-26) replaced
  by LinkedList, because ArrayDeque is only available since Java 1.6 and we want
  to keep MiniConnectionPoolManager compatible with Java 1.5.

2009-06-26 chdh
- Variable recycledConnections changed from Stack to Queue, so that
  the unused connections are reused in a circular manner.
  Thanks to Daniel Jurado for the tip.

- Additional licenses added (EPL/MPL).

2007-06-21 chdh (Christian d'Heureuse)

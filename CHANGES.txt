
MiniConnectionPoolManager Changes
---------------------------------

2016-10-13 chdh
- Extended recycleConnection() to ignore duplicate call to
  ConnectionEventListener.connectionClosed(), caused by faulty JDBC
  driver (SQLite JDBC Driver, Xerial-sqlite-jdbc).

2012-01-24 chdh
- Error corrected which can occur when using the MySQL JDBC driver.
  The JDBC driver may call ConnectionEventListener.connectionErrorOccurred()
  from within PooledConnection.getConnection().
  This led to an AssertionError in disposeConnection().
  Thanks to Gilles Duboscq for reporting and analyzing this error.

2011-05-26 chdh
- New directory structure (Maven compatible).
- The ConnectionEventListener is now kept registered when a PooledConnection
  is put into the recycledConnections list. This enables us to get
  PoolConnectionEventListener.connectionErrorOccurred() events for
  inactive connections.
- New methods added:
   getValidConnection()
   getInactiveConnections()

2009-08-21 chdh
- ArrayDeque (which was introduced with change 2009-06-26) replaced
  by LinkedList, because ArrayDeque is only available since Java 1.6 and we want
  to keep MiniConnectionPoolManager compatible with Java 1.5.

2009-06-26 chdh
- Variable recycledConnections changed from Stack to Queue, so that
  the unused connections are reused in a circular manner.
  Thanks to Daniel Jurado for the tip.

2008-05-03 chdh
- Additional licenses added (EPL/MPL).

2007-06-21 chdh (Christian d'Heureuse)
- Constructor with a timeout parameter added.
